  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/ache.JPG

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    # fonts:
    - family: SourceCodePro
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceCodePro-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceCodePro-Bold.ttf
